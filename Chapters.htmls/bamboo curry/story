Once a foolish Santal son-in-law,
went to his in-law's place. 
His mother-in-law cooked delicious,
dishes for her son-in-law. 
One of the dishes was a curry made 
out of bamboo shoot. 
The son-in-law liked it very much, 
and asked his mother-in-law,
"Mother, the curry is extremely delicious. 
What is the curry made from ?" 
Instead of answering his question, she
pointed at the bamboo door. 
The son-in-law asked, "Is it from bamboo?" 
Yes son, the curry is made from bamboo and is, 
therefore called "Bamboo Curry".

Next day, the son-in-law was 
about to leave for his home. 
The bamboo curry came to his mind. 
He thought of cooking bamboo curry at home. 
But they did not have bamboo. 
So he carried home the bamboo door of his in-laws' house.

Reaching home, he asked his wife to prepare bamboo curry.
He helped his wife in chopping the dry bamboo sticks. 
But the dry bamboo pieces did not get boiled. 
The pieces remained as hard and stiff as before. 
He asked his wife to put more water and boil.
That evening his in-laws came to their son-in-law's house.
The son-in-law offered them the bamboo curry. 
The in-laws laughed at their foolish son-in-law. 
They told him, "The bamboo curry is made from,
soft bamboo shoot and not from dry bamboo pieces".
