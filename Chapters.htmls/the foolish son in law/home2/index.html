    <a onmousedown="s1.play()"><br>He took the pulse of his father-in-law for sometime, and pretended to think.</a>
    <a onmousedown="s2.play()"><br>Then he said "Father-in-law, you must have eaten a cat,</a>

<div class="para2">
    <a onmousedown="s4.play()"><br>He, therefore, used very long and high sounding words.</a>
    <a onmousedown="s5.play()"><br>He told his mother-in-law, "You are the sweetest, kindest, greatest and gentlest lady."</a>
    <a onmousedown="s6.play()"><br>The mother-in-law was very much pleased to hear this.</a>
    <a onmousedown="s7.play()"><br>She praised her son-in-law in front of her neighbours for,</a>

    <a onmousedown="s9.play()"><br>Following strictly the second advice, the son-in-law did not sit on a chair.</a>
    <a onmousedown="s10.play()"><br>He preferred to sit over paddy sacks piled high.</a>
    <a onmousedown="s11.play()"><br>Similarly When any food was given to him, he said, "No".</a>
    <a onmousedown="s12.play()"><br>One night his mother-in-law prepared delicious rice-pudding (Khiri) for him.</a>
    <a onmousedown="s13.play()"><br>When he was served this, he said, No.</a>
    <a onmousedown="s14.play()"><br>Therefore, he was not given rice-pudding. </a>
    <a onmousedown="s15.play()"><br>but two or three drops of rice-pudding fell on his plate. </a>
    <a onmousedown="s16.play()"><br>When he tasted it, he wanted to have more of it. </a>
    <a onmousedown="s17.play()"><br>Thinking it would be impolite, he did not ask for it. </a>
    <a onmousedown="s18.play()"><br>But he wanted somehow to eat the rice-pudding. </a>
    <a onmousedown="s19.play()"><br>He carefully watched his mother-in-law. </a>
    <a onmousedown="s20.play()"><br>She put the rice pudding on a pot and placed it on sikka (a high place).</a>
