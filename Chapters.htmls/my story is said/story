My story is said
The flowering plant is dead.
O flowering plant ! why did you die ?
The black cow ate me up and made me lie.
O black cow! why did the plant you eat?
Because the cowherd did not well me treat.
O cowherd ! why didn't you well the cow treat ?
The daughter-in-law did not give me food to eat.


O daughter-in-law ! why didn't you give food, why?
Because my little baby did cry.
O little baby ! why did you cry?
The ant bit me, that is why.
O ant! why did you bite the little child ?
Under the soil I hide
And bite soft flesh when I do find.
